# Ira Chartarum

## General
The name of the Game is "Ira Chartarum". The motto is "Trading cards meet tabletop." 

Ira Chartarum is a collectible trading card game that is played on a huge board out of hex fields. Its innovative combination of traditional trading card games and tabletop elements presents a new genre of online gaming. In Ira Chartarum you take control of an army of one of the two coalitions: the Iron Federation or the Forgotten Forces. In each coalition there are three factions with different playstyles that can be played individually or together to create different strategies. Each army is led by a powerful hero. At the center of your army is your main building that produces incrementally more resources each turn. Your main buildings grants you a buildrange in which you can deploy units and buildings. You can move and attack with your units and once you have destroyed your opponent’s Main building, you win the game. But be aware: your opponent might be ahead of you and place hidden traps on the board. Use the terrain in your favor with terraforms that change a hex for a given time, giving units on it bonuses or maluses. Events give powerful bonuses for a short period of time and actions can change the tides of battle in an instant.

Ira Chartarum (short Ira) is a two-player game.

## Game Mechanics
Cards in Ira have this information: 1: Mana cost 2: Name 3: Card type 4: Subtype 5: Rarity 6: Stat block 7: Favor

There are six card types in Ira Chartarum. Some card types have specific stats only seen on those cards.

### Unit

Units are the core of every army. Units can be placed at every empty hex in your buildrange and have three stats:

Attack – How much damage a unit can inflict Movement – How far the unit can move in a turn Life – How much damage a unit can take before it dies.

### Building

Buildings can be placed at every empty hex in your buildrange and have two stats:

Buildrange – Your buildrange expands in a radius around the building. Life – How much damage a building can take before it shatters.

### Action

Actions can be played directly from your hand and have an immediate effect. Some actions affect multiple hexes in a given radius. The radius is displayed in the stat block if this is the case.

### Field Trap

A field trap can be placed at any hex which fulfills its placing criteria. Every trap has a trigger condition and an effect. When you play a trap, your opponent only knows that you played a trap, but not which one it is, where it is placed and how much you paid for it.

### Disruptive Trap

A disruptive trap works globally and does not need to be placed at a hex. Only one disruptive trap with the same trigger condition can resolve at a time (the oldest having priority).

### Terraform

Terraforms can be placed at any hex which fulfills its placing criteria. Every terraform has a duration and lasts for that many turns. Most terraforms affect multiple hexes in a given radius. The radius is displayed in the stat block.

### Event

Events have global effects but last only a specific number of turns. The number of turns is displayed in the stat block.

## Win Condition

To win the game, the player must destroy the opponent's main building while protecting their own.
At the start of the game, the main building has 20 life. The main building is the center of your army and produces resources each turn. It also expands your buildrange, which is the area in which you can deploy units and buildings.

When the main building is destroyed, the game ends immediately and the player who destroyed it wins.

It can be damaged in a large variety of ways, including direct attacks from units, actions that target buildings, or when the player can no longer draw cards from their deck.

## Unique Mechanics

Differentiating from other games, Ira Chartarum features a unique combination of trading card game mechanics and tabletop strategy.
Thus, the state of the board has a major impact on the game, and can be manipulated in many ways. Players can place traps, terraforms, and buildings like walls. The board contains water hexes which cannot be passed by units.

Units and Actions can have direct effects or affect areas of the board. 

Units also have a speed, with which they can move across the board.

There are effects to swap units across the board to move them faster.

The 'fuse' mechanic is also unique. Some units can either be played directly or fused onto other units. In the first case, they can only be played within buildrange, but in the second case, they can be fused onto any other own unit anywhere on the board.
