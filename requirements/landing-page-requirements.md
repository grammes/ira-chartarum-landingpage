# Ira Chartarum Landing Page - Final Requirements

## Project Overview
Create a static landing page for "Ira Chartarum" - a complex trading card + tabletop strategy game for core gamers. Focus on showcasing innovative game mechanics and connecting players to the development community.

## Target Audience
- **Core gamers** with patience for learning curves
- **Strategy/TCG enthusiasts** who appreciate mechanical depth  
- **NOT casual gamers** - complexity is a feature, not a bug

## Primary Goals
1. **Generate interest** in the unique game concept
2. **Showcase gameplay mechanics** and innovative design
3. **Connect players** to development community (Discord)
4. **Provide game access** (download installer)

## Core Message
*"A fun, complex game for players who love deep-diving into intricate mechanics"*

## Required Functionality

### Essential Features
- **Hero section** with game name, motto, and key visual
- **Game explanation** focusing on mechanics and innovation
- **Download button** for native Windows installer (http://downloads.ira-chartarum.com/IraUpdater.zip)
- **Discord invite** button (https://discord.gg/Ywz5UYpf)
- **Visual showcase** of cards and gameplay elements

### Unique Mechanics Highlight
- **Fuse Mechanic**: Units can be played directly or fused onto other units anywhere on the board
- **Hidden Information**: Field traps create uncertainty - opponents only know a trap was played
- **Terrain Manipulation**: Terraforms change hex properties for strategic advantage
- **Board State Impact**: Water hexes, walls, area effects create tactical complexity
- **Movement & Positioning**: Unit speed and board movement as core strategic elements
