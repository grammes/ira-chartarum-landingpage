# Progress Log: Ira Chartarum Landing Page

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering âœ… COMPLETE
**Timeline**: Initial session
**Status**: Successfully completed comprehensive requirements interview

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… Game identity and concept documentation
- âœ… Target audience analysis (core gamers, not casual)
- âœ… Technical constraints definition (GitHub Pages, custom domain)
- âœ… Visual asset inventory and style analysis
- âœ… Functional requirements specification
- âœ… Content structure and priority definition

### Key Outputs
- `/requirements/game-requirements-interview.md` - Complete interview responses
- `/requirements/landing-page-requirements.md` - Structured requirements summary
- Visual asset analysis and categorization
- Technology stack constraints and hosting requirements

## Phase 2: Planning âœ… COMPLETE
**Timeline**: Current session
**Status**: Comprehensive Level 3 implementation plan created

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… Complexity assessment (Level 3 - Intermediate Feature)
- âœ… Technology stack validation requirements identified
- âœ… 5-phase implementation strategy developed
- âœ… Creative phase components identified and prioritized
- âœ… Dependencies and integration points mapped
- âœ… Success metrics and testing strategy defined

### Key Outputs
- `/memory-bank/implementation-plan.md` - Comprehensive technical plan
- `/memory-bank/tasks.md` - Updated with detailed phase breakdowns
- `/memory-bank/scenarios/` - User scenario documentation
- Technology validation checkpoint defined as critical path

### Critical Insights
- **Technology Validation Required**: Jekyll + GitHub Pages + Custom Domain must be proven before proceeding
- **Creative Phase Essential**: Visual design system and information architecture need dedicated attention
- **Performance Critical**: Game asset optimization key to success with target audience
- **Community Focus**: Landing page is bridge to Discord development community

## Next Phase: Creative Mode ðŸŽ¨
**Status**: Ready to begin
**Prerequisites**: All planning requirements met

### Creative Components Requiring Attention
1. **Visual Design System** - Extract and systematize colors, typography from game assets
2. **Game Mechanics Presentation** - Information architecture for complex systems
3. **Asset Gallery Design** - Showcase layout and interaction patterns  

### Dependencies for Implementation
- Creative design decisions must be completed before Phase 3 implementation
- Technology validation can begin in parallel with creative phase
- Custom domain configuration dependent on final site structure

## Phase 3: Creative Mode âœ… COMPLETE
**Timeline**: Current session
**Status**: All creative design decisions completed successfully

### Completed Creative Components
- âœ… **Visual Design System** - Hybrid adaptive theme with strategic dark/light section approach
- âœ… **Game Mechanics Presentation** - Visual showcase with mechanics cards layout
- âœ… **Asset Gallery Design** - Hero showcase with supporting gallery architecture

### Key Creative Decisions
- **Color System**: Fire orange (#ff6b35), frost blue (#4a90e2), tech copper (#b87333) extracted from game assets
- **Layout Strategy**: Hybrid approach - dark sections for hero/gallery, light sections for content readability
- **Content Architecture**: Sophisticated visual presentation targeting core gamers who appreciate complexity
- **Asset Prioritization**: Hero treatment for MainMenuBackground, strategic showcase of best cards and artwork

### Design Documentation
- `/memory-bank/creative/creative-visual-design-system.md` - Complete creative phase documentation
- Technical implementation guidelines provided for all components
- CSS custom property system defined with responsive breakpoints
- Component patterns documented (buttons, cards, sections)

### Implementation-Ready Specifications
- Typography system with system font stack and clear hierarchy
- Spacing system based on 8px grid for consistent rhythm
- Image optimization strategy with WebP and fallbacks
- Responsive design patterns for desktop-first approach

## Next Phase: Implementation Mode ðŸ”§
**Status**: Ready to begin
**Prerequisites**: All creative design decisions completed

### Ready for Technical Implementation
- Visual design system specifications complete
- Content architecture and presentation strategy defined
- Asset optimization and display patterns established
- Technology validation can proceed with design system in place

---

**Current Status**: Creative phase complete, ready for `/implement` mode to begin technical development with all design decisions finalized.
